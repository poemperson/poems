our ancestors who once discovered fire
could not imagine what this world's become
our brains have been attached to lights and wire
and soothed to sleep by some electric hum 

i wonder where our human limits end
for new machines to find their way inside
our bodies claiming to be loyal friends
a foolish fate we celebrate with pride

the very few who knew the rulers' plan
have built an ark to save them from the flood
and now distract us any way they can
until the day the oceans turn to blood

our minds, restricted by imperfect form
cannot prepare us for the coming storm
