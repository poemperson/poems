more sleepless nights spent contemplating dreams:
wishes to welcome words from worlds afar
by blue light rivers that carry fresh streams,
my digital door awaiting ajar

for new perspectives, clever deductions
shared by brighter minds what hadn't crossed mine
instead i'm offered soulless productions:
cheap bottled wine strained from hollywood vines

carelessly brewed liquor for the masses,
too far from sober to talk to me now
drinking poison from overflowed glasses
although i can guess, i just can't see how

there's any gain but dissatisfaction
drunk on consumption's empty distractions
