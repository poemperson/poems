**House Far From Home**

games, games, virtual games
the only variety we two could play
i guess it's not hard with a new flagship card
it's the top of the line, at least for today

tomorrow, next week, maybe even next quarter
but what happens after, when the new series drops?
another $2k for the next tallest order?
your hardware, it ages, chokes and then stops

stutters, lags, sputters, gags
trying to render your next gen of fun
fun? is that what you call running your circuits to fry?
brains burst into flames and left there to die?

the audacity!
put down your mouse and your keys for a second
return to the outside that so softly beckons

its tenacity...
reaching its arms out, begging to be remembered
for love like you gave it before you surrendered

humanity:
let's start our games over from the beginning
like little dolls, pink dresses, lace trimmings

reality?
not quite as real as the world that surrounds us
but surely less fake than the wires that bound us

tell me your troubles over plastic teacups
is a sunday noon brunch not fantastic enough
to cast cables aside, replaced with true connection?
a quick game of house for our dreams of affection?

dear, are you there?
sorry, i can't hear well from this side of the screen
no, i do care!
i'm serious, come sit by blue windows and see what i mean

but i have to go soon, my parents are calling
Time's on his way and Nature's impatient
let's wrap this game up, her petals are falling
come on, you can run it, this software is ancient!
