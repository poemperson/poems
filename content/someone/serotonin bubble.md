**Serotonin Bubble**

serotonin bubble,
my heart turns to rubble
 
skipping its beats whenever we meet
though text and intention is all that we have
the meaning sufficient, 
the letters efficient
at mending our minds that were severed in halves

cleaving a split between cold calculating
souls hard and heavy, used only to hating
for years have been waiting
finally freed from the shackles of rage, unabating

questioning karma's reciprocation reveals
a dull and disheartening dilemma:
my attempts at protection prove painfully futile
holding above you a hollowed umbrella

the heavy rain that masks your tears
washes wishful words away with torrents
though then composed to stave away fears
generalizations serve only to insult and torment

is there no way for me, 
o serotonin bubble
to convince you of a future holding troves filled with joy
where your unselfish love will return to you doubled
and your dark disbeliefs will be wholly destroyed?
