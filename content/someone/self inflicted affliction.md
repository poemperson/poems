**Self Inflicted Affliction**

i'm sorry i always seek you to complain
of worries and wishes, so selfish and vain

pain, already stacked so tall on your plate
ways that you suffer, things that you hate
the cruelest of twists brought about you by fate

as i cry to the sky for some magical cure
i crave your embrace to help me endure

life, you breathe in me what ways that you can
with kindest of words, you help me to stand

still i wallow in pity, self inflicted affliction
predictions anyone on their own could have made
if they heard how i begged you, lost and afraid

of being alone,
stranded at home
without a soul to converse with

stiff, unmoving stone,
a heart hard as bone
i pray for some way to reverse it

clinging to you, who has life so much worse
begging your presence to lift off this curse

now tell me, friend, is there some way i could help?
repay with an unselfish part of myself?

to lend you some comfort, like that i desire
or will we burn, codependent, even in fire?
