**Lover's Blades**

lover so kind, wielding weapons so sweet,
select the demise you surmise i should meet
on the edge of your blade i see pale shades reflected
of fragments that hide in your mind, undetected

lover, am i truly worth your valuable time?
disclosing the secrets you've grown to abhor?
as pain paints your pictures, surreal and sublime
i know of you more than i've ever before

lover, now fueled by a rage ever livid,
will i give up my life at the end of your knife?
pouring my veins out with bloodlust so vivid
the weakest i've felt til this moment in life

eviscerating organs i was unsure existed
exposing enigmas i've always resisted
a sense of relief washes over my being
upon finally seeing the me i've been fleeing

there's something so strange about vulnerability
to search for repose in the worlds we create
precariously perched on our practiced abilities
some worn with pride, some hardened by hate

curiosity, seeking some semblance of meaning
swallowed whole by a world unforgiving and cold
burdened with memories so cruel and demeaning
i pray there's still hope for your soft hands to hold

that someday you'll find somewhere safe to sleep soundly
some space far removed from that desolate wasteland
a place you'll experience peace so profoundly
you couldn't believe til you've felt it firsthand
