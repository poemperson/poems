**A Poem That Begs Your Attention**

a poem that begs your attention
makes perfectly clear my intention
of calling your name out in song
a verbose conception
using rhyme and inflection
in hopes that my message rings strong 

how i miss being heard,
to feel that my words
rang loudly and true in your ears
the meaning now blurred
intonation so slurred
succumbing to fear i hold dear

loneliness, my affliction
hopelessness, an addiction
to a self filled with loathing and pity
a pathetic description
of foreseen predictions
wrapped tightly in ribbons, masked and made pretty

to plead for the time you once spared
screamed simply when selfish and scared
seems rather unfair, i believe
neglecting to care,
i spoke unprepared
for contentment with what i received

as your soul screams with sorrow
i ask meekly to borrow
a minute away from your strife
past the silence that follows,
i'll wait 'til tomorrow
to savor my poison, your knife
