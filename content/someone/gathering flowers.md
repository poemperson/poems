**Gathering Flowers**

should you assure me you won't fall in love
i'll write you these poems for hours
hours and hours spent gathering flowers 

pretty pink petals of rhyming and letters 
could my silly creations make somber days better?

it may take a while to put hundreds together
shaped into wings made of colorful feathers
to fly you away from your sorrow

though perhaps not today or tomorrow.
i'll try every day for the sake of your peace
i'll write any way that my brain could conceive 
to provide you with sweet and cathartic release
