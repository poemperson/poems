**Please Let Me Sleep**

gradually losing my soundness of mind
when all that surrounds me appears to be fine
such subtle signs say i may become blind

eyes are but extensions of my weary brain
driven insane as i close them in vain
feigning there may be some rest to be gained

on those nights
oh, those nights
so restless and wired
so hopelessly tired
my body begs "sleep!" with eyelids sewn tight 

such chaos! 
my head
burns fiercely inside
the flames which i dread
"don't you wish you had died?"

stupid machine, itself contradicting
commanding my body with worthless conviction
knowing nothing but fiction
seeking some soothing from rhyme and from diction

repose, would you bestow
me with even a strip of it?
its mocking ensues:
"is that your true desire?"

it knows the answer's no.
like that thing i am some hypocrite
forever fanning you, 
sweet everlasting fire
