**The Songs I Leave Behind**

at times i find my mind in circles runs
around kind words i'd heard throughout the years 
that then were meant by friends, remaining none
no, not a single soul to lend an ear
 
my thoughts which once felt so important sit
now stagnant in my throat, so coarse and dry
i wish you'd stay and listen for a bit
to what i have to say and ask me why

alas, i can't expect to steal your time
much better focused on the day to day
instead i'll hold to heart these woes of mine
and write them down in hopes that they will stay

for when i pass, the songs i leave behind
will be my only remnants left to find
