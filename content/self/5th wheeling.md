**5th Wheeling**

being fifth wheel ain't that big a deal
as long as everyone has a good time
but my mind browses feelings i don't want to feel
ultimately deciding that everything's fine

my moment will come, it will make me ecstatic
to know there's another to share in my static
erratic behaviors that some may call manic
	
to be understood can't be that hard. 
or can it?
i just need the right person to visit and hold
my complex and calloused and traumatized soul

made whole as a victim of unpredictable circumstance
i long for a lover to relinquish this lonely dance
