**The Old Man, His Dog, and Coincidence**

today i had a conversation with God in the ocean
He didn't say much, but i hoped that He washed out my sins in the waves
i felt at peace.

today i went to a European style village and saw an old man with a dog
he looked content, and i wondered if i should approach him
in the end i didn't, but to this day i wonder what he might have said

not everything has to be symbolic
not everything has to tie together
most things are born and die regardless of their significance to me
not every song has a deeper meaning
not every piece of art is meant for me to see myself in
not everything is a parallel
there is a such thing as coincidence

sometimes fiction is fiction and nothing more
sometimes it's pointless to overthink
does art imitate life
or do i imitate art in an attempt to give my life meaning?
