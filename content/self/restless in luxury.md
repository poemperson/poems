**Restless in Luxury**

on nights my stubborn eyes refuse to shut
the engine in my skull denies me rest
as tension takes hold of my knotted gut
unwanted thoughts become unwelcome guests

an introspection of a certain kind
returns in black to haunt me now and then
i stare through foggy windows in my mind
and ask myself these questions yet again:

should not the placid life that I've achieved
create a state of peace and sweet release?
how must i see the blessings i've received 
to make this melancholic longing cease?

no matter how i've tried to hide or flee
for now, the dark has yet to hear my plea
