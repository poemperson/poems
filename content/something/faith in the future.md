**Faith in the Future**

our fantasies can often lead our minds
to places far removed from where we are
those dreams of other worlds we wish to find
in coins tossed into wells or toward a star

for how can what surrounds us satisfy
the cravings for a slice of paradise?
how easy it would be to say goodbye
and sell off life for such a measly price

but don't you see its worth is so much more?
there's peace you can't imagine within reach	
though now your heart has sunken to the floor,
reality has so much left to teach:

patience, faith, rest assured; your love will come
though now you know not where it may fall from
