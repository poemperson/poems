**Infinite Ocean**

life isn't a bad time
in fact it's often quite good
as it should, i'm inclined to agree
or else why stop by knowing i'd have to leave?

when the last elevator closes its doors
to an ocean of floors at mere buttons' reach
each unimaginably real as the next

i'd suggest, if i had the audacity
a guess as to which of the levels i'd land
but how foolish and proud is to claim the capacity
to grasp a new world til i've felt it firsthand
