**How Could There Be More?**

i know language well, or at least i had guessed
from the scratch of each marking right down to the dot
everything i read made logical sense 
not a thing to describe that writing could not

each jot has a meaning:
taking some substance removed from the rest
the world of words teeming
with picturesque treasures that nothing could best

lest there should be some unknown dimension
new ways to describe an existence so wide
if letters had means - beyond our mere vision
to make themselves known to the sky from inside

if they could be transmitted through some holy medium
from my soul to your soul directly, true freedom
imagined, without having written a word

absurd, i know, is the very notion
that there may be some way or some sound or some motion
to thrust these thoughts through the air, our emotions

if you know of such a wonder, won't you please tell me?
write a real message to let me know clearly
with quite little effort you'd certainly sell me
on a way to feel words, those friends i love dearly
