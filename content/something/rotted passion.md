**Rotted Passion**

i can smell hollywood reeking from the production
vision unrecognizable from its induction
the script was the same, as were all the actors
but each with new names, with every line doctored

for what is the dream of a single producer
when tied with the lives of investors involved?
not just of the people, but of corporate abusers
whose lies would revise the whole piece to evolve

or devolve, i should say, is a better description.
mess dissolved, truth lost inside of this twisted depiction
of what was once one's heartfelt message to send
erased and reframed 'til start met bitter end
