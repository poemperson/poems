**Dead Cord**

*d*esolate, once sturdy fortress lies in waste
*e*viscerated, empty veins bled slowly dry
*a* gruesome fate has met the place which died in haste
*d*ear friends of mine, i need now ask you only why

*c*ould we have not brought brighter days to bid farewell?
*o*r had the prophecies we jokingly did there tell
*r*ightly spell the end we'd head toward:
*d*ead cord
