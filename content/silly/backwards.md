well, at least i can say i tried my best.
it was somewhat of a tricky test
a poem that reads bottom-up and top-down
yes, i am aware of how silly it sounds

to try what has likely many times been attempted
yet for some reason i found myself tempted
to go to such trouble making something so pointless

there was nothing to gain
there was nothing to lose
it caused me no pain
not a cut or a bruise

it left a pretty good taste in my mouth
with newfound pride in my artistic ability
it managed to validate my creativity
when i put to this test my verbal agility

a poem that reads bottom-up and top-down
turns out it wasn't as hard as it sounds
i think i did okay
