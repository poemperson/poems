desolate, once sturdy fortress lies in waste
eviscerated, empty veins bled slowly dry
a gruesome fate has met the place which died in haste
dear friends of mine, i need now ask you only why

could we have not brought brighter days to bid farewell?
or had the prophecies we jokingly did there tell
rightly spell the end we'd head toward:
dead cord
